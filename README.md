Hi! I'm an app developer, designer, amateur triathlete, and photographer who loves walking.

I'm currently working in a cyber-security company as an iOS developer. There is a big chance you've heard of it. On weekends and free time that feels like programming, I work on [Tride](https://tride.app) â€” an indie cycling and running app for all Apple products. 


- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning digital signal processing and ML applications for activity tracking and training load predictions.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@totocaster](https://twitter.com/totocater) or email.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I shoot a lot of photos that are not published yet, but you can see some of my snaps [here](https://photos.codedesigncoffee.net).

P.S. I just discovered this GitHub feature, to be updated with more goodies soon.
